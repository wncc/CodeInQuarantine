# Week 5 | FrontEnd Development

## Introduction to jQuery
Now that you have learnt to create webpages using HTML, styling it with CSS and making it interactive with JavaScript let's move forward to an easy way of manipulating the HTML structure using a JS library called jQuery.

### What is jQuery?
jQuery is one in a long list of JS frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, React etc. that provide an easy and convenient way for HTML document traversal and manipulation (DOM), event handling, animation, and Ajax. It is a programming script that runs in the web browser.
Mastering jQuery is quite an easy task and can be done in a few hours, depending on your expertise in JavaScript.

### Downloading jQuery
Head over to the [downloads page](https://jquery.com/download/) of jQuery and download the latest version of the script.

### Getting Started
Once you have downloaded jQuery, place the jquery.js in the scripts folder of your website and get started with customizing the interactions in the website with the tools that jQuery provides.
For beginners here is a list of websites:
- #### [Official documentation and learning center](https://learn.jquery.com)
- #### [A step-by-step guide to learn the basics within a few hours](https://blog.cloudboost.io/best-jquery-tutorials-to-help-you-master-it-in-just-few-hours-2ce1be915bd5)

### Tasks
[Here is a list of exercices to practice what you have learnt in jQuery](https://www.w3resource.com/jquery-exercises/)

Once you have a decent working knowledge on jQuery and JavaScript in general, you can also try [some complex and interesting applications](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-advjquery2/index.html)
